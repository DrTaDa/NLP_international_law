#task: search the keywords and ascertain the context
# step 1: in the json, loop the keywords firstly in the pdf titles, and the documents match one or more keywords, take out these documents and make the keywords their context.
# step 2: for the rest of documents that titles do not match keyword, search the wordings "agenda item" that is nearest to "non-intervention" (before "non-intervention"), and loop the keywords.
# step 3: for the rest of documents that have no clear titles or no agenda item before non-intervention, search the keywords within the 100 words above and after non-intervention, or probably use distance search, the unsupervised one?

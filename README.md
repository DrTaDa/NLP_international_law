This study will look into the context in which the non-intervention principle is raised, the countries to raise the principle, and the forums for these claims.

The intended outcomes include:

(1) a global map with countries of mentioning the non-intervention principle

(2) a distribution pie chart with context in eight big sections: 1) economic intervention, 2) military intervention, 3) international cooperation, 4) humanitarian peacekeeping peace/security, 5) human rights, 6) UN laws, 7) political intervention, 8) regional movements.

(3) the forums for these keywords in bar chart:

To search whether there appear these words such as “General Assembly”, ‘Security Council, “'Economic and Social Council”, “International Court of Justice”, “'Trusteeship Council” in the first 50 words in the PDF documents, and calculate how many times these wordings appear separately, and make a bar chart. 

Notice: there are sub-categories under each forum:
See:
'General Assembly': ['Human Rights Council', 'International Law Commission', 'First Committee', 'Second Committee', 'Third Committee', 'Fourth Committee', 'Six Committee', 'Disarmament Commission', 'Conference on Disarmament', 'Committee on Disarmament', 'Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations', 'General Assembly']
'Security Council': ['Counter-Terrorism Committee', 'Military Staff Committee', 'Security Council']
'Economic and Social Council': ['Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice', 'Narcotic Drugs']
'International Court of Justice': ['International Court of Justice']
'Trusteeship Council': ['Trusteeship Council']

(4) the connotations of the non-intervention principle (a common formula), and whether it is commonly mentioned with other principles (including non-use of force, aggression, sovereignty, sovereign equality) in the same sentence.
